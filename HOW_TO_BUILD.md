# How to build for Windows

Since you are currently on macOS, you cannot directly generate a `.exe` file for Windows. The build process must accept Windows binaries (DLLs) which are only available on Windows.

To build the Windows executable, follow these steps:

1.  **Copy the entire project folder** to a Windows computer.
2.  Ensure **Python 3.10+** is installed on that Windows computer.
3.  Open the folder, and double-click **`build_windows.bat`**.
    *   This script will automatically install all necessary libraries (`requirements.txt`) and run PyInstaller.
4.  Once finished, you will find the program in the **`dist/ThaiDanceScoring`** folder.
    *   You can zip this folder and share it.
    *   The executable is `ThaiDanceScoring.exe` inside that folder.

## Note on Antivirus
Some antivirus software (including Windows Defender) might flag unassigned `.exe` files generated by PyInstaller as suspicious. This is a common false positive. You can exclude the folder or sign the executable if this is for production.
